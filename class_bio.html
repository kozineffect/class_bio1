		<p>I drink beer all day every day. When I hear that glass break I walk out to the ring and stomp a mudhole in someone. WHAT?! I said I stomp a mudhole in someone! What?! I STOMP MUDHOLES! I have headlined multiple pay-per-view events for the WWF, including three WrestleManias (XIV, XV, and X-Seven). I was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 due to a series of knee injuries and a serious neck injury. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, I was featured as the Co-General Manager and "Sheriff" of Raw. Since 2005, I continued to make occasional appearances, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009 by Vince McMahon.</p>
